# Deep-learning-tensorflow-
Basic deep learning model with the Tensorflow
TensorFlow is used as a development platform for deep learning algorithms, in particular for:
1. Recommendations: selecting the best templates to recommend to users via email in the various countries the company has a market in, over 100 languages supported,
2. User feedback classification: when users provide feedback, natural language processing algorithms implemented in TensorFlow and Keras are used to classify issues so that stakeholders can identify the major issues with a product/product release,
3. Learning-to-rank for search: there is some development on improving search results by switching to deep learning algorithms from a gradient boosting one, and TensorFlow provides that capability, and
4. Computer vision: some experimentation performed on object detection and image classification.
